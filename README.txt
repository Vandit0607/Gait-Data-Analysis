1. Standard Libraries such as Sci-Kit Learn, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib are used to facilitate the machine learning models

2. The project contains 8 Files
	a. The main file is used to run all the code
	b. KNN.py for K-Nearest Neighbors
	c. SVM_Linear.py for Support vector machines with a linear kernel 
	d. SVM_Poly.py for Support vector machines with a Polynomial kernel
	e. SVM_Sigmoid.py for Support vector machines with a Sigmoid kernel
	f. Random_Forest.py for Random Forest algorith
	g. Plot1.py for plotting
	h. merger.py to merge the datasets in ./CSV/
To Run,
Run the main file
That creates Transformed_Co and Transformed_Pt that are used as filtered dataset to run the machine learning algorithms
